					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to organize your files and organize your homepage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> As I was adding my information, I deleted the past picture and code but when I refreshed the page in my browser, it still appeared. I was checking everywhere to check where that code could possibly be and I could not find it anywhere in vscode. I checked the file in github and thats where I found the piece of code that was not visible in vscode but was on github. I deleted the section tags and that fixed it somehow.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put some pretty good effort in here because I ran into some problems and was able to figure it out </p>
